### How to install
1. Clone project: `git clone https://github.com/alexal1/Insomniac.git`
2. Install [uiautomator](https://github.com/xiaocong/uiautomator) and [colorama](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/): `pip3 install uiautomator colorama`
3. Download and unzip [Android platform tools](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools), move them to a directory where you won't delete them accidentally, e.g.
```
mkdir -p ~/Library/Android/sdk
mv <path-to-downloads>/platform-tools/ ~/Library/Android/sdk
```
4. [Add platform-tools path to the PATH environment variable](https://github.com/alexal1/Insomniac/wiki/Adding-platform-tools-to-the-PATH-environment-variable). If you do it correctly, terminal / command prompt command `adb devices` will print `List of devices attached`

### How to install on Raspberry Pi OS
1. Update apt-get: `sudo apt-get update`
2. Install ADB and Fastboot: `sudo apt-get install -y android-tools-adb android-tools-fastboot`
3. Clone project: `git clone https://github.com/alexal1/Insomniac.git`
4. Install [uiautomator](https://github.com/xiaocong/uiautomator) and [colorama](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/): `pip3 install uiautomator colorama`

### Get started
1. Connect Android device to your computer with a USB cable
2. Enable [Developer options](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options#enable) on the device
>On Android 4.1 and lower, the Developer options screen is available by default. On Android 4.2 and higher, you must enable this screen. To enable developer options, tap the Build Number option 7 times. You can find this option in one of the following locations, depending on your Android version:
>
> Android 9 (API level 28) and higher: Settings > About Phone > Build Number
>
> Android 8.0.0 (API level 26) and Android 8.1.0 (API level 26): Settings > System > About Phone > Build Number
>
> Android 7.1 (API level 25) and lower: Settings > About Phone > Build Number
3. Switch on **USB debugging** (and **Install apps via USB** if there is such option) on the Developer options screen.
4. Device will ask you to allow computer connection. Press "Connect"
5. Type `adb devices` in terminal. It will display attached devices. There should be exactly one device. Then run the script (it works on Python 3):
```
cd <path-to-project>/Insomniac
python3 insomniac.py --interact <username1> <username2> ...
```
Make sure that the screen is turned on and device is unblocked. You don't have to open Instagram app, script opens it and closes when it's finished. Just make sure that Instagram app is installed. If everything's fine, script will open each blogger's followers and like their posts.

### Analytics
There also is an analytics tool for this bot. It is a script that builds a report in PDF format. The report contains account's followers growth graphs for different periods. Liking, following and unfollowing actions' amounts are on the same axis to determine bot effectiveness. The report also contains stats of sessions length for different configurations that you've used. All data is taken from `sessions.json` file that's generated during bot's execution.

### Why Insomniac?
There already is [InstaPy](https://github.com/timgrossmann/InstaPy), which works on Instagram web version. Unfortunately, Instagram bots detection system has become very suspicious to browser actions. Now InstaPy and similar scripts work at most an hour, then Instagram blocks possibility to do any actions, and if you continue using InstaPy, it may ban your account.

That's why need arised in a solution for mobile devices. Instagram can't distinguish bot from a human when it comes to your phone. However, even a human can reach limits when using the app, so don't fail to be careful. Always set `--total-likes-limit` to 300 or less. Also it's better to use `--repeat` to act periodically for 2-3 hours, because Instagram keeps track of how long the app works.
